# GoldBadge_Challenges
For this project, I have created three console applications one of cosnsole app to allow a cafe to add, remove and get all items off the menu. The second was for an insurance company to deal with claims. So they could view all claims pullc claims and see all claims. The last was a dictionary of badges that could be edited and added and displayed.

For the gold badges challenges I tried worked hard to keep everything within their individual folders. I di have problems with the console apps themselve because the system.generic elements werent working properly. So i had to create it outside the folder. I learned a lot about methods in testing. The hardest issue I had was trying to pull items from a List<t. have them print individually to the console. I learned a lot about Queue's and Dictionaries as well but had a little trouble figuring out how to add and remove items from the dictionary. Luckily, Michael was able to guide me to the correct way.

I really enjoyed this project and hope to continue furthering my knowledge on the language of C# sharp and the .Net Framework.
